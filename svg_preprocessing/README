## How to run the preprocessing

All SVG fills need to be cleaned up based on their source.

Many SVG may have groups, transform and other things.

With [SVGO](https://svgo.dev/docs/), we can simplify a lot the language with mostly low precision path sequences.

Here is an example of command :
```
svgo --config=svgo.config.mjs -i output.svg   -p 1 --pretty --indent 2 --multipass --datauri unenc -o output_2.svg
```

A whole folder can be cleaned up with a recursive cmd :
```
for f in *; do
  echo $f
  svgo --config=../svgo.config.mjs -i $f  -o $f.new
done
```

It avoids some OOM errors

Some files were filed with file type character, they can be cleaned with

```
for f in *; do
  echo $f
  sed 's/data:image\/svg+xml,data:image\/svg+xml,//' $f > $f.new.new
done
```
